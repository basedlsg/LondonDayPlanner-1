That analysis was excellent and identified critical issues. Now I need expert UI/UX consultation for this multi-city day planner before deployment. The analysis revealed:

**CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS:**
1. **Non-functional QR code** - draws fake pattern instead of real QR code
2. **Exposed API keys** - Google Places API key hardcoded in frontend 
3. **Inconsistent component styling** - mix of native elements and design system
4. **Poor error handling UX** - using alert() instead of proper feedback
5. **Duplicated loading components** - multiple different implementations

**SPECIFIC UI/UX QUESTIONS:**
1. **Mobile-First Experience**: How should the itinerary display adapt for mobile users? Should we use cards, lists, or a different layout pattern?

2. **Input Simplification**: The current free-text input relies on complex NLP parsing. Should we provide a more structured input method (time slots, location dropdowns) as an alternative?

3. **Loading Experience**: Currently showing 5-15 second response times. What's the best UX pattern for keeping users engaged during AI processing?

4. **Error Recovery**: When itinerary generation fails, how should users be guided to retry or modify their request?

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Should we show partial results as they're generated, or wait for the complete itinerary?

6. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: This app works on web and mobile (Capacitor). What UI patterns work best across both?

I need actionable recommendations for these UX challenges, considering this is a travel planning app where users need quick, reliable results.
