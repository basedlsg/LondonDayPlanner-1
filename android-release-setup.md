# üöÄ Android App Store Release Guide

## Step 1: Generate Release Keystore

```bash
# Navigate to android/app directory
cd android/app

# Generate keystore (you'll be prompted for passwords and details)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore plan-perfect-day-release.keystore \
  -alias plan-perfect-day \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# When prompted, use these details:
# Keystore password: [SECURE PASSWORD - SAVE THIS!]
# Key password: [SAME AS KEYSTORE PASSWORD]
# First/Last name: Plan Your Perfect Day
# Organization unit: PlanYourPerfectDay.app
# Organization: PlanYourPerfectDay.app
# City: [Your city]
# State: [Your state]
# Country code: [Your country code]
```

## Step 2: Configure Signing

Create `android/app/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=[YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD]
keyPassword=[YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD]
keyAlias=plan-perfect-day
storeFile=plan-perfect-day-release.keystore
```

## Step 3: Update build.gradle

Add to `android/app/build.gradle` (above android block):
```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('app/key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Build Release AAB

```bash
# From project root
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Your AAB will be at:
# android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
