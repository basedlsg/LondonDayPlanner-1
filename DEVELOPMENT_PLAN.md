# London Day Planner - Comprehensive Development Plan

## Vision: Intelligent Multi-City Itinerary Planner

### Target User Journey
A business traveler visits `/london`, enters a complex multi-stop query with time constraints and preferences, and receives an optimized itinerary they can immediately add to their calendar and view on maps.

### Example Query Analysis
**Input**: "I'm in Canary Wharf now -- have a call 10 AM - need a quiet place to talk preferably with good coffee. Will work from there until 3 PM, then I have a meeting in Mayfair at 5, would like a nice but non-crowded place for a coffee shop, then i would like to pick up some kitchenware for the house before going back to the house (Canary Wharf) around 9 PM"

**Parsed Components**:
- **Starting Location**: Canary Wharf
- **Time Block 1**: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM (5 hours work block)
- **Venue Requirements**: Quiet, good coffee, suitable for calls and work
- **Fixed Appointment**: Mayfair at 5:00 PM
- **Activity 2**: Coffee shop (non-crowded, near Mayfair)
- **Activity 3**: Kitchenware shopping
- **End Location**: Return to Canary Wharf by 9:00 PM
- **Travel Constraints**: Must account for London transport between areas

## Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1.1 Multi-City Timezone Support
**Current Issue**: London routes showing NYC time
**Purpose**: Each city must display times in its local timezone
**Files**: `server/routes.ts`, `server/lib/timeUtils.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Fix timezone formatting to use `cityConfigInstance.timezone`
- Test with London config (`Europe/London`)
- Verify `/london/plan` endpoint works correctly
- Ensure time display shows BST/GMT appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `/london/plan` shows London time (not NYC time)
- [ ] `/nyc/plan` shows NYC time
- [ ] Times display correctly for each city's timezone

### 1.2 City Route Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure all city endpoints are functional
**Implementation**:
- Test routing for `/london`, `/nyc`, `/boston`, `/austin`
- Verify city configs load properly
- Confirm area data exists for each city

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All city routes respond correctly
- [ ] City-specific business categories work
- [ ] Area data loads for each city

## Phase 2: Intelligent Query Processing (Priority: HIGH)

### 2.1 Advanced Natural Language Parsing
**Purpose**: Extract complex itinerary requirements from natural language
**Current Gap**: Only handles simple single-venue queries

**Components to Extract**:
1. **Time Blocks**: "work from 10 AM - 3 PM"
2. **Fixed Appointments**: "meeting in Mayfair at 5"
3. **Venue Preferences**: "quiet place", "good coffee", "non-crowded"
4. **Activity Types**: "coffee shop", "kitchenware shopping"
5. **Travel Constraints**: "back to Canary Wharf by 9 PM"
6. **Location Sequence**: Start → Work → Meeting → Shopping → End

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ParsedItinerary {
  startLocation: string;
  endLocation: string;
  timeBlocks: TimeBlock[];
  fixedAppointments: FixedAppointment[];
  activities: FlexibleActivity[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  constraints: TravelConstraint[];
}

interface TimeBlock {
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  activity: string;
  location?: string;
  requirements: string[];
}

interface FixedAppointment {
  time: string;
  location: string;
  duration?: number;
  bufferBefore?: number;
  bufferAfter?: number;
}

interface FlexibleActivity {
  type: string; // 'coffee', 'shopping', 'dining'
  preferences: string[];
  timePreference?: 'before' | 'after' | 'between';
  relatedTo?: string; // which appointment/block
}
```

**Gemini Prompt Enhancement**:
- Structured JSON output with time parsing
- Location extraction and normalization
- Preference categorization
- Travel constraint identification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parses time blocks ("work from X to Y")
- [ ] Identifies fixed appointments with locations
- [ ] Extracts venue preferences and requirements
- [ ] Understands travel constraints and sequences

### 2.2 Location Intelligence

**London Area Database Enhancement**:
- **Canary Wharf**: Financial district, business-friendly venues
- **Mayfair**: Upscale area, premium coffee shops, high-end shopping
- **Shoreditch**: Creative area, independent coffee shops
- **Covent Garden**: Shopping, accessible from multiple transport links
- **King's Cross**: Transport hub, modern workspaces

**Features**:
1. **Area Recognition**: "Mayfair" → lat/lng + area characteristics
2. **Travel Time Calculation**: Canary Wharf ↔ Mayfair via DLR/Tube
3. **Route Optimization**: Logical sequence planning
4. **Area-Appropriate Suggestions**: Business venues in financial areas, etc.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface AreaIntelligence {
  name: string;
  characteristics: string[]; // ['business', 'quiet', 'upscale']
  transportLinks: TransportHub[];
  businessTypes: VenueType[];
  averageTravelTimes: Record<string, number>; // to other areas
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Recognizes major London areas
- [ ] Calculates realistic travel times between areas

  workFriendly: boolean;
  maxDuration: number; // in hours
  amenities: {
    wifi: boolean;
    powerOutlets: boolean;
    quietZones: boolean;
    phoneCallsAllowed: boolean;
    coffeQuality: number; // 1-5 rating
  };
