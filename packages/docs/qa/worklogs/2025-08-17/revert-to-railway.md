# Worklog: Reverting to Railway Deployment

**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Author:** Roo

## Objective

The goal of this task was to revert the project to a previously working Railway deployment configuration. Recent changes had migrated the deployment to Vercel and Render, and a stable Railway version needed to be restored.

## Changes Made

1. **Investigation**:
   - Analyzed the project's commit history using `git log` to identify the last stable commit before the Vercel and Render migrations.
   - Identified commit `2108985` as the target for the revert.

2. **Revert Process**:
   - Created a new branch, `revert-to-railway`, from commit `2108985`.
   - This branch now contains the version of the codebase that was last successfully deployed to Railway.

3. **Automation and Documentation**:
   - Created a shell script, `revert_to_railway.sh`, to automate the process of reverting to the Railway deployment.
   - Created a runbook, `revert_to_railway_runbook.md`, with clear instructions on how to use the script.

## Evidence

- **Branch**: `revert-to-railway`
- **Script**: `revert_to_railway.sh`
- **Runbook**: `revert_to_railway_runbook.md`
