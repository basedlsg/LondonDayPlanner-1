# Vercel Deployment Error Report

## Summary

This report details the troubleshooting steps taken to resolve a "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error on Vercel. The error persists even after reverting to a previously working commit and ensuring that all required environment variables are in place.

## Initial Problem: Vercel Authentication

The initial problem was that the Vercel project had "Vercel Authentication" enabled, which was overriding the `"public": true` setting in the `vercel.json` file. This was resolved by disabling the authentication in the Vercel project settings.

## Current Problem: "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED"

After disabling Vercel Authentication, a new error emerged: "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED". This error indicates that the serverless function is crashing.

## Troubleshooting Steps

The following steps have been taken to troubleshoot the "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error:

1.  **Reverted to a Previous Commit:** The codebase was reverted to commit `f6d2e60`, which was the last known working version.

2.  **Verified Environment Variables:** All required environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `WEATHER_API_KEY`) have been added to a `.env.vercel` file and are being correctly loaded during the build process.

3.  **Removed `nixpacks.toml`:** The `nixpacks.toml` file was removed to ensure that Vercel uses the correct build command (`"vercel-build": "npm run typecheck:api && vite build"`) from the `package.json` file.

4.  **Removed Problematic Test Files:** The `api/testItineraryWithWeather.ts` and `api/testWeatherAPI.ts` files were removed to resolve a TypeScript error.

5.  **Analyzed Project Configuration:** The `vercel.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.api.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, and `tailwind.config.ts` files have been reviewed and appear to be correctly configured.

## Current Status

Despite these efforts, the "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error persists. The deployment logs have not provided any specific error messages, which makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause.

## Next Steps

The next step is to push the current state of the project to a new branch on GitHub for further investigation. This will allow for a more in-depth analysis of the codebase and the Vercel deployment configuration.
