# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" error on Vercel deployment by addressing TypeScript compilation issues, environment variable loading, database connection problems, and import path resolution issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel deployment to start successfully, so that the API endpoints are accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vercel function starts THEN it SHALL load environment variables correctly without relying on .env files
2. WHEN the function initializes THEN it SHALL establish database connection without throwing unhandled errors
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN it SHALL complete without errors or warnings
4. WHEN import paths are resolved THEN they SHALL work correctly in the Vercel serverless environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose deployment issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL log specific missing variables and continue with fallbacks where possible
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN the API receives requests THEN it SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the API health check endpoint to work, so that I can verify the service is running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access /api/health THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with service information
2. WHEN the database is connected THEN the health check SHALL include database status
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the health check SHALL indicate configuration status
4. WHEN the service is ready THEN all API endpoints SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized for Vercel, so that deployments are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel builds the project THEN it SHALL use the correct TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN they SHALL be compatible with the serverless environment
3. WHEN the function bundle is created THEN it SHALL be optimized for cold start performance
4. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN they SHALL be read directly from process.env without file system operations
