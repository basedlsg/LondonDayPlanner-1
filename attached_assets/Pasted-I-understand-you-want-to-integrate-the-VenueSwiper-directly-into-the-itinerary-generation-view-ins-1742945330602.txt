I understand - you want to integrate the VenueSwiper directly into the itinerary generation view instead of keeping it as a separate page. Here's a prompt for implementing this:

```
Integrate the VenueSwiper component directly into the itinerary generation view, allowing users to see and select venue alternatives without navigating to a separate page.

Implementation:
1. Locate the itinerary display component (likely in pages/itinerary.tsx or a similar file)
2. For each venue in the itinerary, replace the static venue display with the VenueSwiper component
3. Pass the primary venue and its alternatives to the VenueSwiper
4. Add a callback function to handle when a user selects an alternative venue
5. Update the UI to make it clear users can swipe to see alternatives

Example implementation:
```jsx
// In the itinerary display component:

import VenueSwiper from '../components/VenueSwiper';

// Inside the component where venues are rendered:
{itinerary.places.map((place, index) => (
  <div key={place.id} className="mb-6">
    <div className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-1">
      {formatTime(place.scheduledTime)}
    </div>
    
    {/* Replace static venue card with VenueSwiper */}
    <VenueSwiper
      primary={place}
      alternatives={place.alternatives || []}
      onSelect={(selectedVenue) => handleVenueSelection(index, selectedVenue)}
    />
    
    {/* Travel time to next location */}
    {index < itinerary.places.length - 1 && (
      <div className="flex items-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
        <MapPinIcon className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
        <span>{itinerary.travelTimes[index].duration} min to next location</span>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
))}
```

Add the venue selection handler:
```jsx
const handleVenueSelection = (index, selectedVenue) => {
  // Create a copy of the itinerary
  const updatedPlaces = [...itinerary.places];
  // Replace the venue at the specified index
  updatedPlaces[index] = selectedVenue;
  // Update the itinerary state
  setItinerary({
    ...itinerary,
    places: updatedPlaces
  });
  
  // You might also want to update the database or state management
  // depending on your application architecture
};
```

Make sure the UI indicates swiping is available:
1. Add a subtle indicator showing "1/4" or similar to indicate more options
2. Consider adding a small hint the first time ("Swipe to see alternatives")
3. Make sure the swipe area has sufficient width on mobile devices
