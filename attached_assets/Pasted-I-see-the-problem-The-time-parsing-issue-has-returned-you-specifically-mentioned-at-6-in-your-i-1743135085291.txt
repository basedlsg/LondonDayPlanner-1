I see the problem. The time parsing issue has returned - you specifically mentioned "at 6" in your input, but the system parsed it as 12:00 PM instead of 6:00 PM. Let's create a targeted prompt that focuses exclusively on fixing this time parsing bug:

# Critical Fix: Time Parsing in London Day Planner

There is a critical time parsing bug in the London Day Planner application. The system is not correctly extracting time information from user input.

## Specific Issue to Fix:
The system is incorrectly parsing "at 6" as 12:00 PM instead of 6:00 PM. This appears in the server logs:
```
time: '12:00',
searchTerm: 'Hello at 6 -- where can I have a coffee with some friends in Canary Wharf?'
```

## Locate and Fix the Time Parsing Function:

1. **Find the Time Parsing Logic:**
   - Look in `server/lib/nlp.ts` or `server/lib/languageProcessing.ts` 
   - Search for functions related to time extraction (like `parseTimeExpression`, `extractTime`, etc.)
   - Find where the system extracts time from user input strings

2. **Fix the Regular Expression Pattern:**
   - The regex pattern is likely missing or incorrectly handling the "at X" time format
   - Ensure the regex matches patterns like "at 6", "at 9", etc.
   - Make sure it correctly converts these to 24-hour format (18:00, 21:00)

3. **Debug With Console Logs:**
   - Add detailed logging to show exactly what time expressions are being detected
   - Log the input string, detected time patterns, and final time value
   - This will help pinpoint where the extraction is failing

## Example Code Fix:

Look for code similar to this and ensure the regex pattern includes the "at X" format:

```javascript
// Find something like this:
function parseTimeExpression(text) {
  // Add or fix regex to handle "at X" format
  const atTimePattern = /\bat\s+(\d{1,2})(?:\s*([ap]\.?m\.?))?\b/i;
  
  // Check for "at X" pattern
  const atTimeMatch = text.match(atTimePattern);
  if (atTimeMatch) {
    let hour = parseInt(atTimeMatch[1]);
    // Default to PM for ambiguous times like "at 6" (common for dinner/evening times)
    const isPM = atTimeMatch[2] ? 
                atTimeMatch[2].toLowerCase().startsWith('p') : 
                (hour >= 1 && hour <= 7); // Assume 1-7 without AM/PM specified is PM
    
    if (isPM && hour < 12) hour += 12;
    return `${hour.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:00`;
  }
  
  // Rest of the existing time parsing logic...
}
```

## Testing:
Test the fix with various time formats to ensure it works consistently:
- "at 6" → should become 18:00 (6:00 PM)
- "at 9 PM" → should become 21:00 (9:00 PM)
- "at 10 AM" → should remain 10:00 (10:00 AM)

Focus EXCLUSIVELY on fixing this time parsing issue. Do not modify any other code or functionality.
