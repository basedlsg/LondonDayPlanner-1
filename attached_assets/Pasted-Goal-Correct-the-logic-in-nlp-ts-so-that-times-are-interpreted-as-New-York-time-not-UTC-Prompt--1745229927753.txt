Goal: Correct the logic in nlp.ts so that times are interpreted as New York time, not UTC.

Prompt:
"The server logs show the timezone conversion is incorrect. For example, it logs:
Converted time "10:00" to NYC time: 2:00 AM (2025-04-21T06:00:00.000Z)

This is wrong. '10:00' from the user request (meaning 10 AM NYC time) should result in a display time of '10:00 AM' and the corresponding UTC ISO string (which would be ...T14:00:00.000Z during EDT). The current logic seems to be treating '10:00' as UTC.

Open server/lib/nlp.ts. Go to the convertGeminiResultToAppFormat function.

Find the specific code that processes the time string (like "10:00") from Gemini's fixedTimeEntries and flexibleTimeEntries. It's currently producing the incorrect time (ISO string) and displayTime values.

Replace the existing incorrect time conversion logic for both fixed and flexible entries with the correct date-fns-tz approach below. Ensure any old, incorrect logic is removed:

// Ensure this import is present at the top:
import { zonedTimeToUtc, format, utcToZonedTime } from 'date-fns-tz'; 

// --- Inside the loop processing each entry from Gemini ---
const timeStringFromGemini = entry.time; // e.g., "10:00"
const timeZone = 'America/New_York';

// Get today's date components IN the target timezone to avoid DST issues at midnight
const nowInNYC = utcToZonedTime(new Date(), timeZone);
const year = nowInNYC.getFullYear();
const month = String(nowInNYC.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
const day = String(nowInNYC.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');

// Construct the date string *representing the intended time in NYC*
const dateTimeStringInNYCTz = `${year}-${month}-${day}T${timeStringFromGemini}:00`;

// Parse this string *as if it's in NYC* and get the correct UTC Date object
const utcDate = zonedTimeToUtc(dateTimeStringInNYCTz, timeZone);

// Generate the correct ISO string representing this moment in UTC
const correctIsoTimestamp = utcDate.toISOString();

// Generate the correct display string by formatting the UTC time *back* to NYC time
const correctDisplayTime = format(utcDate, 'p', { timeZone }); // 'p' = 'h:mm aa' format

// --- Update the app's fixedTime entry ---
// Assign correctIsoTimestamp to the 'time' field.
// Assign correctDisplayTime to the 'displayTime' field.

// Add this log for verification:
console.log(`Correctly interpreted time "${timeStringFromGemini}" as NYC time: ${correctDisplayTime} (${correctIsoTimestamp})`);
// --- End of loop ---
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Restart the server and test with a query like 'Coffee at 10am'. Verify the new log message shows the correct interpretation (e.g., Correctly interpreted time "10:00" as NYC time: 10:00 AM (...T14:00:00.000Z) assuming EDT)."
