You're absolutely right! The system is making elementary errors despite having access to powerful tools like Google Maps API and Gemini. This is a critical oversight in the implementation.

Here's an updated prompt that focuses on properly leveraging these existing integrations:

# Critical Fix: Properly Utilize Google Maps API and Gemini for Location Processing

There's a fundamental implementation issue in the London Day Planner. Despite having access to Google Maps API and Gemini AI, the application is making elementary location parsing errors. This needs to be fixed immediately by properly leveraging these powerful services.

## Core Issues to Address

### 1. Gemini AI Integration Failure

The logs consistently show: "AI processing skipped - using basic fallback structure"

* Investigate why Gemini integration is being skipped:
  - Check if the API key is properly configured in environment variables
  - Verify the Gemini API connection is working
  - Look for error handling that may be silently failing and defaulting to the basic fallback
  - Fix any timeout or rate limiting issues in the API call

* Ensure the Gemini prompt is optimized for location extraction:
  ```javascript
  // Update the Gemini prompt to emphasize location importance
  const prompt = `
    You are a London travel planning expert. 
    
    Carefully analyze this request: "${query}"
    
    CRITICAL: Accurately identify specific London neighborhoods, districts, and areas.
    Pay special attention to locations preceded by prepositions like "in", "at", "near".
    Never generalize specific neighborhoods (like Hackney, Canary Wharf, etc.) to just "London".
    
    Return a JSON structure with:
    {
      "exactLocation": string, // The most specific location mentioned
      "neighborhood": string,  // The London neighborhood
      "confidence": number    // Your confidence in this extraction (0-1)
    }
  `;
  ```

### 2. Google Maps API Underutilization

The system appears to make a single Google Places API call without proper location validation:

* Add a preliminary Google Maps geocoding step:
  ```javascript
  async function validateAndNormalizeLocation(location: string): Promise<string> {
    // Use Google Maps Geocoding API to verify this is a valid London location
    const geocodeUrl = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${encodeURIComponent(location + ", London")}&key=${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}`;
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(geocodeUrl);
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (data.status === "OK" && data.results && data.results.length > 0) {
        // Extract the most specific administrative area component
        const addressComponents = data.results[0].address_components;
        
        // Look for neighborhood or sublocality level components
        const neighborhood = addressComponents.find(
          component => 
            component.types.includes("neighborhood") || 
            component.types.includes("sublocality_level_1")
        );
        
        if (neighborhood) {
          return neighborhood.long_name; // Return the official neighborhood name
        }
      }
      
      return location; // Return original if geocoding fails
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error validating location:", error);
      return location; // Fallback to original on error
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Two-Phase Location Verification

Implement a robust two-phase verification process:

```javascript
async function processLocationWithAIAndMaps(query: string) {
  // Phase 1: Try Gemini AI extraction first
  try {
    const geminiResult = await extractLocationWithGemini(query);
    
    if (geminiResult && geminiResult.confidence > 0.7) {
      // High confidence - verify with Google Maps
      const verifiedLocation = await validateAndNormalizeLocation(geminiResult.exactLocation);
      console.log(`Gemini extracted "${geminiResult.exactLocation}", verified as "${verifiedLocation}"`);
      return verifiedLocation;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Gemini extraction failed:", error);
    // Continue to fallback
  }
  
  // Phase 2: Fallback to direct extraction + Google Maps validation
  const extractedLocations = extractLocationsFromText(query);
  
  if (extractedLocations.length > 0) {
    // Sort by specificity/length (longer names tend to be more specific)
    extractedLocations.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length);
    
    // Validate the most specific location
    const verifiedLocation = await validateAndNormalizeLocation(extractedLocations[0]);
    console.log(`Direct extraction found "${extractedLocations[0]}", verified as "${verifiedLocation}"`);
    return verifiedLocation;
  }
  
  // Last resort - generic location
  return "London";
}
```

### 4. Integration Point in the NLP Pipeline

Modify the parsing pipeline to use this enhanced location processing:

```javascript
// In parseItineraryRequest function
async function parseItineraryRequest(query: string): Promise<StructuredRequest> {
  try {
    // Try Gemini first (with proper error handling)
    const geminiResponse = await tryGeminiParsing(query);
    
    if (geminiResponse) {
      // Process and verify the Gemini results
      // ...
    } else {
      console.log("AI processing skipped - using enhanced location processing");
      
      // Extract basic structure but use enhanced location processing
      const extractedLocations = extractLocationsFromText(query);
      
      // Process each potential location through Google Maps verification
      const verifiedLocations = await Promise.all(
        extractedLocations.map(loc => validateAndNormalizeLocation(loc))
      );
      
      // Continue with the rest of the parsing...
    }
    
    // Final location verification
    if (parsedRequest.fixedTimes && parsedRequest.fixedTimes.length > 0) {
      for (const fixedTime of parsedRequest.fixedTimes) {
        // Only process if location looks generic
        if (fixedTime.location === "London" && fixedTime.searchTerm) {
          const enhancedLocation = await processLocationWithAIAndMaps(fixedTime.searchTerm);
          if (enhancedLocation !== "London") {
            fixedTime.location = enhancedLocation;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    return parsedRequest;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in enhanced itinerary parsing:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Debug and Fix Gemini API Issues:**
   - Add verbose logging around Gemini API calls
   - Implement proper error handling with fallbacks
   - Check API key validity and quota limits

2. **Improve Google Places Search:**
   - Modify search to properly prioritize venues in the correct neighborhood
   - Add location bias parameters to keep results in the specified area
   - Validate returned venues against the requested neighborhood

3. **End-to-End Testing:**
   - Create tests that verify the entire pipeline from input → Gemini → Google Maps → venue search
   - Build a test suite with varied inputs that previously failed
   - Implement monitoring to detect when the system falls back to basic parsing

This approach leverages both Gemini AI and Google Maps API to their full potential, creating a robust location processing system that should eliminate these elementary errors once and for all.
