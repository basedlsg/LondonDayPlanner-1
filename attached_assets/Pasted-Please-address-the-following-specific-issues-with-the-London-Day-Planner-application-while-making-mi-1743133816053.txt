Please address the following specific issues with the London Day Planner application while making minimal changes to the existing codebase:
1. Fix Location Parsing

The system is incorrectly parsing specific neighborhoods (e.g., "Nine Elms") as generic "London"
Update the location extraction logic in the NLP module to properly recognize London neighborhoods
Add a verification step to ensure extracted locations match the user's input
Add specific handling for phrases like "in [neighborhood]" to capture location context

2. Fix Time Display Discrepancy

There's a mismatch between the scheduled time (12:00 PM) and displayed time (01:00 PM)
Check for timezone conversion issues in the time formatting logic
Ensure consistent time format between backend processing and frontend display
Verify the formatTime utility is correctly handling 12/24 hour formats

3. Reduce UI Whitespace

Significantly reduce the excessive whitespace between the input form and itinerary results
Add a CSS rule to limit the maximum gap to approximately 40-60px
Ensure the itinerary section appears closer to the input form after submission
Improve the scrolling behavior to show both sections with minimal scrolling

4. Display Date Information

Add the date to the itinerary display along with the time
Format date consistently with the application style
Use the date selected in the input form

5. Debug AI Processing Fallback

Investigate why "AI processing skipped - using basic fallback structure" is occurring
Check if all required environment variables are properly set
Verify the AI service connection is working correctly
Add better error handling for AI service failures

Implementation Approach:

Focus on identifying and fixing the specific bugs rather than rewriting components
Add targeted console logging to trace the data flow issues
Preserve the existing UI design while adjusting spacing
Test with specific neighborhood inputs to verify location parsing fixes

The goal is to make surgical fixes to these specific issues while maintaining the overall structure and design of the application.
