Please enhance the London Day Planner UI with these specific improvements to create a premium glass effect while strictly adhering to our brand guidelines:

1. Typography (Critical):
   * Logo/Headings: Use Rozha One font ONLY for "PLAN" and main headings
   * Body Text: Use Poppins SemiBold for ALL other text elements
   * Apply proper letter spacing (+5% for headings, normal for body)
   * Ensure proper text hierarchy with Rozha One for "PLAN" at 32px and "What's The Plan?" at 24px
   * Text color should be #1C1C1C (our brand black) for optimal contrast

2. Enhanced Glass Effect:
   * Apply a sophisticated frosted glass effect ACROSS THE ENTIRE INTERFACE
   * Base background: #FC94C5 (our brand pink) with subtle radial gradient
   * Add refined backdrop-filter: blur(15px) with proper opacity layers
   * Implement thin (1px) white inner borders on glass panels for definition
   * Add subtle light reflection along top edges of glass elements

3. Main Card Enhancement:
   * Implement premium glass card with blue tint gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.25), rgba(23,185,230,0.15))
   * Add sophisticated depth with box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
   * Increase internal padding by 15% for more luxurious spacing
   * Apply subtle transition animations between states

4. Interactive Elements:
   * Style "Create Plan" button with our brand blue (#17B9E6) using a subtle gradient
   * Add refined hover states with scale transforms (1.02x)
   * Style form inputs with consistent glass effect and subtle inner shadows
   * Reduce placeholder text opacity to 60% for elegance

5. Premium Details:
   * Add minimal decorative elements (subtle geometric accents)
   * Implement proper spacing hierarchy using golden ratio principles
   * Add subtle entrance animations for page elements
   * Ensure all rounded corners are consistent (12px radius)

6. Venue Swiper (if applicable):
   * Apply consistent glass effect to venue cards
   * Selected card should have #17B9E6 border highlight
   * Add minimal pagination dots centered below cards
   * Include subtle navigation arrows for desktop

Ensure all elements follow a consistent design language with proper visual hierarchy while maintaining the sophisticated glass aesthetic. Typography treatment is particularly critical - Rozha One and Poppins SemiBold must be implemented exactly as specified.
