1. Fix Incorrect Location Normalization

Remove all hardcoded location mappings that incorrectly convert distinct neighborhoods
Use the Google Places API to validate locations directly without intermediate mappings
Preserve neighborhood names in their original form (e.g., keep "Mayfair" as "Mayfair", not "Green Park")
Add a London location validation system that differentiates between neighborhoods, landmarks, and streets

2. Overhaul Activity Type Handling

Create a proper mapping system that converts natural language activities to appropriate Google Places API types:

"breakfast/lunch/dinner" → "restaurant"
"coffee" → "cafe"
"meeting" → should NOT be used as a venue type parameter
"arrive" → should NOT be used as a venue type parameter


For non-venue activities like "meeting", use the activity for scheduling but don't send it to the Places API
Add context-specific venue searches (e.g., for "meeting" look for appropriate venues like "coffee_shop" or "restaurant")

3. Improve Venue Diversity & Relevance

Expand search parameters to return multiple options, not just the first result
Add ranking mechanisms that prioritize venues based on:

Relevance to the activity type
Distance from the location
Ratings and reviews


Implement a diversity filter to avoid returning the same venue for different queries
Store previously recommended venues to avoid duplication in the same itinerary

4. Implement Smart Starting Location Handling

When no starting location is specified, implement a graceful fallback:

If a destination is mentioned, use that as the starting point for a circular journey
For early morning requests, default to major transport hubs (Liverpool St., King's Cross, etc.)
Use time of day to suggest logical starting points


Provide clear, conversational feedback when making assumptions about starting locations

5. Fix Time Interpretation

Add support for relative time references:

"morning" → 9:00-11:00
"afternoon" → 12:00-17:00
"evening" → 17:00-21:00


Handle approximate times with reasonable defaults
Convert all recognized time patterns to standard format before processing

6. Implement Structural Changes

Separate the location validation logic from activity search logic
Create a two-stage process:

First identify and validate all locations mentioned
Then search for appropriate venues for each activity at each location


Add comprehensive error handling that provides useful feedback when locations or activities are ambiguous

Implementation Approach

Update the NLP module to properly distinguish between neighborhoods, activities, and times
Rewrite the location normalization logic to preserve original location names
Create a separate module for activity-to-venue-type mapping
Implement a more sophisticated search strategy that returns diverse, relevant results
Add input validation with helpful error messages for partial or ambiguous inputs
