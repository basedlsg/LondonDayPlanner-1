Yes, please implement this enhanced Gemini prompt approach! Your assessment is spot-on, and this implementation will address the systemic issues we've been seeing.

Here's how to get started:

## 1. First, update nlp.ts with the new Gemini prompt

```typescript
// In nlp.ts
export async function parseItineraryRequest(query: string): Promise<StructuredRequest> {
  try {
    // Use our comprehensive Gemini prompt
    const response = await gemini.generateContent(`
      You are a London travel planning expert with deep knowledge of London's geography, neighborhoods, and venues. Analyze this request carefully:
      
      "${query}"
      
      TASK: Provide a complete interpretation for creating a London itinerary with Google Places API integration.
      
      Step 1: Identify all London locations with full context:
      - Distinguish between neighborhoods (Soho, Mayfair), landmarks (British Museum), and transport hubs (King's Cross)
      - For ambiguous references, clarify which specific London location is meant
      - Recognize colloquial area names and local terminology (The City, West End, etc.)
      
      Step 2: Understand all activities with venue-specific details:
      - Extract explicit activities (coffee, lunch, museum visit)
      - Infer implied activities based on context ("something nice" → what specifically?)
      - Capture qualitative requirements (quiet, fancy, historic, family-friendly)
      - Note when activities are vague and need appropriate venue suggestions
      
      Step 3: Interpret time references carefully:
      - Convert all time formats to 24-hour format
      - Handle time ranges correctly (e.g., "between 2-4pm" → 14:00-16:00)
      - Interpret relative times (morning, afternoon, evening) 
      - Avoid creating duplicate activities for similar times
      
      Step 4: Create optimal Google Places search parameters:
      - Provide the exact search term to use (e.g., "specialty coffee shop" rather than just "coffee")
      - Specify the correct Google Places 'type' parameter (cafe, restaurant, museum, etc.)
      - Suggest additional keywords that will improve search relevance
      - Recommend minimum rating thresholds based on quality expectations
      
      RETURN ONLY this JSON structure:
      {
        "startLocation": string | null,
        "destinations": string[],
        "activities": [
          {
            "description": string, // Original activity description from request
            "location": string, // Where this should happen
            "time": string, // Time in 24h format or period name like "afternoon"
            "searchParameters": { // CRITICAL - Parameters for Google Places API
              "searchTerm": string, // Optimized search term (e.g., "quiet cafe with workspace")
              "type": string, // Google Places API type parameter (e.g., "cafe", "restaurant")
              "keywords": string[], // Additional keywords to improve search
              "minRating": number, // Recommended minimum rating (1.0-5.0)
              "requireOpenNow": boolean // Whether time constraints require the venue to be open now
            },
            "requirements": string[] // Special requirements like "quiet", "outdoor seating"
          }
        ],
        "preferences": {
          "venueQualities": string[], // Qualities applying to all venues (upscale, budget, etc.)
          "restrictions": string[] // Restrictions applying to all venues (no chains, etc.)
        }
      }
    `);

    // Process the Gemini response...
    // Rest of your parsing code with proper error handling
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

## 2. Update schema.ts to support the new structure

You'll need to extend your types to handle the new response format:

```typescript
// In schema.ts, add these new types

export type SearchParameters = {
  searchTerm: string;
  type: string;
  keywords: string[];
  minRating: number;
  requireOpenNow: boolean;
};

export type Activity = {
  description: string;
  location: string;
  time: string;
  searchParameters: SearchParameters;
  requirements: string[];
};

export type EnhancedRequest = {
  startLocation: string | null;
  destinations: string[];
  activities: Activity[];
  preferences: {
    venueQualities: string[];
    restrictions: string[];
  };
};
```

## 3. Begin updating googlePlaces.ts

Start with enhancing the searchPlace function to use the rich parameters:

```typescript
// In googlePlaces.ts
export async function searchPlace(
  location: string,
  options: {
    searchTerm?: string;
    type?: string;
    keywords?: string[];
    minRating?: number;
    requireOpenNow?: boolean;
  } = {}
): Promise<VenueSearchResult> {
  try {
    // Build a semantically rich search query
    let searchQuery = '';
    
    if (options.searchTerm) {
      // Use the complete natural language query suggested by Gemini
      searchQuery = `${options.searchTerm} in ${location}, London`;
    } else {
      // Fallback to basic location search
      searchQuery = `${location}, London`;
    }
    
    // Continue with existing searchPlace logic, but enhanced with the new parameters
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

After you've implemented these foundations, we can proceed with the routes.ts changes and further enhancements. Let me know if you need specific guidance on any part of the implementation!
