Enhance the gap-filling logic in routes.ts to make better activity suggestions.

Implementation:
1. Improve findInterestingActivities() in routes.ts to consider:
   - Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening activities)
   - Weather conditions (suggest indoor activities when raining)
   - User preferences (activity types, budget, etc.)
   - Area characteristics (match activities to area specialties)

Testing:
Create a test file testGapFilling.ts:

import { findInterestingActivities } from './routes';

function testGapFilling() {
  // Test cases with different parameters
  const testCases = [
    {
      location: "Covent Garden",
      duration: 1.5,
      timeOfDay: "10:30",
      preferences: { type: "cultural", requirements: ["indoor"] }
    },
    {
      location: "South Bank",
      duration: 2,
      timeOfDay: "14:00",
      preferences: { type: "relaxing", requirements: ["outdoor"] }
    },
    {
      location: "Soho",
      duration: 3,
      timeOfDay: "19:00",
      preferences: { type: "dining", requirements: ["lively"] }
    }
  ];
  
  console.log("--- Testing Gap Filling Logic ---");
  
  for (const test of testCases) {
    console.log(`\nScenario: ${test.duration} hours in ${test.location} at ${test.timeOfDay}`);
    console.log(`Preferences: ${test.preferences.type}, Requirements: [${test.preferences.requirements.join(', ')}]`);
    
    const suggestions = findInterestingActivities(
      test.location,
      test.duration,
      test.timeOfDay,
      test.preferences
    );
    
    if (suggestions.length === 0) {
      console.log(`❌ No activities suggested`);
    } else {
      console.log(`✅ Suggested activities (${suggestions.length}):`);
      suggestions.forEach((activity, i) => {
        console.log(`  ${i+1}. ${activity}`);
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Test time appropriateness
  console.log("\n--- Testing Time Appropriateness ---");
  const timeTests = [
    { time: "08:00", location: "King's Cross" },
    { time: "13:00", location: "Soho" },
    { time: "19:00", location: "Shoreditch" },
    { time: "22:00", location: "Soho" }
  ];
  
  for (const test of timeTests) {
    console.log(`\nAt ${test.time} in ${test.location}:`);
    const suggestions = findInterestingActivities(test.location, 1.5, test.time, {});
    if (suggestions.length > 0) {
      console.log(`✅ Suggested: ${suggestions[0]}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`❌ No activities suggested`);
    }
  }
}

testGapFilling();

Debug:
- If no suggestions are provided, check the matching logic
- For inappropriate time suggestions, verify the time slot handling
- If suggestions don't match preferences, check the filtering
